For METHOD 2 (ID:2915089), it also uses recursion to find the GCD of two numbers but with a slight variation in the approach.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the main idea behind each method.\nThe next step is to determine the main idea behind each method. Both methods aim to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Step 3: Write the summaries based on the identified characteristics and ideas.\nBased on the identified characteristics and ideas, we can now write the summaries for each method.\n\nFor METHOD 1 (ID:2586916): This method uses recursion to calculate the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the modulo operation and swapping the inputs until one is zero.\n\nFor METHOD 2 (ID:2915089): This method finds the GCD of two numbers by recursively calling itself with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller one.\n\n### Step 4: Format the summaries as required.\nFinally, we need to format the summaries as required, which is in JSON format with exactly two fields: \"summary1\" and \"summary2\".\n\nHere are the formatted summaries:\n\n<json>{\"summary1\": \"This method uses recursion to calculate the GCD of two numbers",
    "summary2": "<json>\n{\"summary1\": \"This method recursively calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\", \"summary2\": \"This method implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers.\"}\n<json> {\"summary1\": \"This method uses recursion to calculate the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the modulo operation and swapping the inputs until one is zero.\", \"summary2\": \"This method finds the GCD of two numbers by recursively calling itself with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller one.\"} </json> \n<json> {\"summary1\": \"This method uses recursion to find the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one and taking the remainder.\", \"summary2\": \"This method calculates the GCD of two numbers by recursively finding the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller one.\"} </json> \n\n### Step 1: Identify the key characteristics of each method.\nThe first step is to identify the key characteristics of each method. For METHOD 1 (ID:2586916), it uses recursion to find the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the modulo operation and swapping the inputs until one is zero. For METHOD 2 (ID:2915089), it also uses recursion to find the GCD of two numbers but with a slight variation in the approach.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the main idea behind each method.\nThe next step is to determine the main idea behind each method. Both methods aim to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Step 3: Write the summaries based on the identified characteristics and ideas.\nBased on the identified characteristics and ideas, we can now write the summaries for each method.\n\nFor METHOD 1 (ID:2586916): This method uses recursion to calculate the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the modulo operation and swapping the inputs until one is zero.\n\nFor METHOD 2 (ID:2915089): This method finds the GCD of two numbers by recursively calling itself with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller one.\n\n### Step 4: Format the summaries as required.\nFinally, we need to format the summaries as required, which is in JSON format with exactly two fields: \"summary1\" and \"summary2\".\n\nHere are the formatted summaries:\n\n<json>{\"summary1\": \"This method uses recursion to calculate the GCD of two numbers"
