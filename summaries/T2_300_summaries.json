It checks if the source and destination tables exist, creates the destination table if it does not exist, and then inserts data into the destination table.\n\n**Summary of Method 2 (ID:19984810)**\n\nThis method is similar to Method 1, but uses different SQL queries to check for the existence of tables and views. It also uses the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` instead of `USER_TABLES` and `USER_VIEWS`. The logic is identical to Method 1. \n\nNote that both methods have the same functionality, but with slight differences in how they interact with the database schema. Method 2 appears to be an updated version of Method 1. \n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to make any changes to the summaries or add anything else. \n```java\n/**\n * Copies data from one table to another.\n *\n * @param p_eboctx EboContext object\n * @param srcTableName name of the source table\n * @param destTableName name of the destination table\n * @param where optional filter condition\n * @param log whether to log the operation\n * @param mode mode of operation (0 or 1)\n * @return true if successful, false otherwise\n */\npublic static boolean copyDataToNewTable(EboContext p_eboctx, String srcTableName, String destTableName, String where, boolean log, int mode) throws boRuntimeException {\n    //...\n}\n```\nHere are the summaries:\n\n**Method 1 (ID:10115630)**\n\nCopies data from one table to another by creating the destination table if it doesn't exist and inserting data into it.\n\n**Method 2 (ID:19984810)**\n\nSimilar to Method 1, but uses different SQL queries to check for table existence and interacts with the database schema using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any changes! \n\nAlso, I noticed that both methods have the same code structure and functionality, but with some minor differences in the SQL queries used.

It checks if the source and destination tables exist, creates the destination table if it does not exist, and then inserts data into the destination table.\n\n**Summary of Method 2 (ID:19984810)**\n\nThis method is similar to Method 1, but uses different SQL queries to check for the existence of tables and views. It also uses the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` instead of `USER_TABLES` and `USER_VIEWS`. The logic is identical to Method 1. \n\nNote that both methods have the same functionality, but with slight differences in how they interact with the database schema. Method 2 appears to be an updated version of Method 1. \n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to make any changes to the summaries or add anything else. \n```java\n/**\n * Copies data from one table to another.\n *\n * @param p_eboctx EboContext object\n * @param srcTableName name of the source table\n * @param destTableName name of the destination table\n * @param where optional filter condition\n * @param log whether to log the operation\n * @param mode mode of operation (0 or 1)\n * @return true if successful, false otherwise\n */\npublic static boolean copyDataToNewTable(EboContext p_eboctx, String srcTableName, String destTableName, String where, boolean log, int mode) throws boRuntimeException {\n    //...\n}\n```\nHere are the summaries:\n\n**Method 1 (ID:10115630)**\n\nCopies data from one table to another by creating the destination table if it doesn't exist and inserting data into it.\n\n**Method 2 (ID:19984810)**\n\nSimilar to Method 1, but uses different SQL queries to check for table existence and interacts with the database schema using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any changes! \n\nAlso, I noticed that both methods have the same code structure and functionality, but with some minor differences in the SQL queries used.

The second summary differs slightly between the two methods. \n\nThe code provided appears to be written in Java and uses JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It seems to execute two SQL queries and print the results to the console.\n\nHere are my observations about the code:\n\n* Both methods have similar structure and logic.\n* They establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.\n* They execute two SQL queries: `wdbInit` and `sql`.\n* The `wdbInit` query is executed as an update statement using `statement.execute()`, while the `sql` query is executed as a select statement using `statement.executeQuery()`.\n* The results of the `sql` query are retrieved and printed to the console.\n* There are some differences in the way the `sql` query is constructed, but this does not affect the overall functionality of the code.\n\nBased on these observations, I will provide two possible summaries for each method.\n\nFor Method 1:\n\n* Summary 1: This method establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC and executes two SQL queries.\n* Summary 2: This method also retrieves data from the database and prints it to the console.\n\nFor Method 2:\n\n* Summary 1: This method establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC and executes two SQL queries.\n* Summary 2: This method also retrieves data from the database and prints it to the console.\n\nHowever, since the second summary is identical for both methods, I will provide a different summary for Method 2.\n\nFor Method 2:\n\n* Summary 1: This method establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC and executes two SQL queries.\n* Summary 2: It then prints out the results of the second query to the console.\n\nHere are the JSON objects with the summaries:\n\n<json>{\"summary",
